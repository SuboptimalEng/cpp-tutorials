# WebGPU Cross Platform App

In this video, we go over the code from Google's WebGPU Cross Platform App tutorial written by [Francois Beaufort](https://github.com/beaufortfrancois). We also go over some interesting tidbits I learned (about C++ and WebGPU) along the way.

Note: The code example worked on the first try, but I had a lot of questions. So I asked ChatGPT and added the comments to this example code. Wanted to make this video largely for my own future reference.

## Learning Approach

Here's my learning approach for anyone else going down the same path.

I cloned the repository, followed the steps to run it on my machine (using the commands specified in the repo, which worked on the first run). I asked ChatGPT a lot of questions about WebGPU and copied some info to the .cpp file with the comments. I also formatted the file to make it more readable (for me) using the a .clang-format file.

Basically, the code is the same, but it has comments that I find helpful.
