# ðŸ”® C++ Tutorials

This repo contains the code for my C++ tutorials on YouTube. Since C++ is a huge
language, I plan to use Bjarne Stoustrup's [4th edition exercises](https://www.stroustrup.com/4thExercises.pdf)
as a rough guide for my study plan (and videos). However, I don't plan to follow
them to the letter. I will likely deviate from them and go over any topic that I
find interesting.

As such, these C++ tutorials are not meant to be consumed in any specific order
(even though each folder will be numbered). This ordering represents "the moment
in time when I found that specific topic interesting". It does NOT represent
"the order in which you should learn that topic".

<!-- For example, the first folder, titled `01-gdb-lldb-debugging` is likely a
topic at the intermediate level, but I learned it first (and made a video)
because I needed to step through some SFML code in my Shader Game Engine. The
second folder titled `02-compiler-linker` is a beginner friendly topic, but I
dove into it at a later point. In my ideal world, each video and/or folder is
fully self-contained and has all the info needed to learn that specific topic.
We'll see how that goes. -->

## Who is this for?

First and foremost, these C++ tutorials are meant for me. I find that I tend
to forget topics that I've previously learned in a few months if I don't use
them day-to-day. For example, I'll definitely forget many of the `lldb` commands
if I don't use them often enough. So these tutorials act as a reference for my
future self in-case I need a quick guide to help me get back up to speed.

Aside from me, the type of person who will find these tutorials most useful is
someone who who has completed 2+ years of undergraduate study in computer science.
You won't see me make a tutorial like "How to write a for-loop in C++" because
I don't find that interesting. (Unless of course, there are some very obscure
ways to do it in C++, which might be fun to learn and explain.)

## Why am I learning C++?

I started my career in TypeScript as a full-stack web developer. Got bored a few
years ago and transitioned to working in computer graphics. C++ is the "lingua
franca" of graphics programming so I decided to learn it.

Additionally, as an engineer, it's always good to be familiar with a statically
typed langauge -- especially, if you've spent your entire career solely in the
JavaScript (or Python) ecosystem. I'd definitely recommend learning a language
like C++, Java, or Go.

<!-- I've also discussed my reasoning for why I'm switching from TypeScript to C++
for graphics programming in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbN_Arh8_ec). -->

## Why not Rust?

One of the most common questions I got when explaining my reasons for switching
from TypeScript to C++ for graphics programming was -- "Why not Rust"?

The short answer, is that I don't like programming in Rust.

The long answer, is that I strongly believe C/C++ is the best language for
graphics programming (and many other subfields of computer science that I find
interesting). I do not believe this is going to change anytime in the next 5-7
years. I'm always happy to update my priors, but for the time being, this is my
definitive stance on the matter.
